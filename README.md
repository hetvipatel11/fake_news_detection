## ABOUT THE PROJECT
###### This project is unique among software development projects in that it focuses on the creation of machine learning models. Machine Learning needs a big and high-quality dataset, as well as a substantial amount of time for model training and model testing. In other words, if the predicted outcome, the model is called correct. The model, for example, may anticipate and categorise the appropriate sort of news as either false or fake.
